HGH (Somatropin),Human Growth Hormone | 191aa Recombinant Growth Hormone,Injectable,"Start 1-2 IU daily, assess tolerance before increasing",Injectable,Ongoing / 3-6 month cycles,"Lyophilized: refrigerate 2-8°C; Reconstituted: refrigerate, use within 14-28 days; Never freeze",Once daily (morning) or split AM/PM at higher doses,"Abdomen (most common), thigh, upper arm - rotate sites",Morning on empty stomach for fat loss; evening mimics natural secretion; split doses at higher amounts,"1-2 weeks: improved sleep, energy; 4-8 weeks: fat loss begins, skin improvement; 3-6 months: significant body composition changes, full benefits",3-6 months minimum for body composition; can be used long-term under medical supervision,Some protocols cycle 5 days on/2 days off or take periodic breaks; medical replacement is typically continuous,"What is HGH (Somatropin)?
Human Growth Hormone (HGH), also known as somatropin or somatotropin, is a 191 amino acid single-chain polypeptide hormone naturally produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Recombinant HGH (rhGH/somatropin) is bioidentical to endogenous growth hormone and is FDA-approved for growth hormone deficiency in children and adults, as well as several other conditions. The '191aa' designation refers to its complete 191 amino acid structure, distinguishing it from older 192aa formulations. HGH regulates growth, metabolism, body composition, and numerous physiological processes through direct actions and via stimulating IGF-1 production.
Key Benefits
Improved body composition (increased lean mass, decreased fat mass), enhanced bone mineral density, improved lipid profile, increased exercise capacity, better quality of life and mood, skin and hair improvements, enhanced recovery and healing
Mechanism of Action
HGH binds to GH receptors on target tissues, triggering JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway. Direct effects include lipolysis, protein synthesis stimulation, and metabolic regulation. Indirect effects occur via IGF-1 stimulation in liver and peripheral tissues, promoting growth, cell proliferation, and anabolism. Half-life: ~3 hours subcutaneously; peak levels 3-5 hours post-injection.","Weight

HGH decreases insulin sensitivity and can cause insulin resistance. Diabetics may need increased insulin doses. Monitor blood glucose closely when combining
HGH stimulates endogenous IGF-1 production. Adding exogenous IGF-1 compounds effects but increases hypoglycemia and side effect risks
HGH increases T4 to T3 conversion and can unmask central hypothyroidism in 36-47% of patients. Monitor thyroid function; may require T4 supplementation
GHRH analog that stimulates natural GH release. Can be used with HGH for enhanced effects, though may be redundant if using adequate HGH doses
Ghrelin mimetic that stimulates GH release via different pathway. Combination may enhance overall GH/IGF-1 axis but increases complexity
Growth hormone releasing peptides work synergistically with HGH. Can enhance natural pulsatile release alongside exogenous administration
HGH can unmask cortisol deficiency in hypopituitary patients. Cortisol replacement should precede HGH therapy in patients with multiple deficiencies
Commonly combined in hormone replacement protocols. Both support anabolism, body composition, and well-being. Monitor estrogen conversion
Metformin may be used to manage HGH-induced insulin resistance. Some evidence suggests metformin may reduce IGF-1 levels - monitor response

SLU-PP-332 is a groundbreaking synthetic small-molecule compound developed at Saint Louis University that functions as a pan-estrogen-related receptor (ERR) agonist with preferential activity at ERRα. Often called an 'exercise mimetic,' it activates metabolic pathways typically engaged during physical exercise without requiring actual physical activity. By enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and energy expenditure, SLU-PP-332 has demonstrated remarkable effects across multiple systems including weight loss (12% in 28 days), improved exercise capacity (70% increase in endurance), enhanced insulin sensitivity, cardiac protection, and reversal of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. While showing tremendous promise in preclinical studies with favorable safety profiles in multiple animal models, it remains in research-only status with no human clinical trials yet conducted. Researchers at the University of Florida are working to advance this compound toward human studies and developing an oral pill formulation for easier administration.
Key Benefits
Exercise mimetic effects without physical activity, significant weight loss (12% in 28 days), 70% increased endurance, 25% enhanced fatty acid oxidation, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic steatosis, cardiac protection, reversal of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced muscle oxidative capacity
Mechanism of Action
Binds to and activates estrogen-related receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ) which regulate gene expression for energy metabolism. Upregulates PGC-1α (master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis), activates AMPK pathway (cellular energy switch), increases mitochondrial density up to 1.8-fold, enhances oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, promotes fatty acid oxidation, induces type IIa oxidative muscle fiber genes, and activates acute aerobic exercise genetic programs.","Weight

Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is a 28-amino acid neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. Acting through VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors, VIP regulates immune function, vascular tone, circadian rhythms, and neurological health. It has been extensively studied for chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS), pulmonary conditions, autoimmune diseases, and most recently COVID-19 respiratory failure. The injectable form (Aviptadil/Zyesami) received FDA Fast Track designation for COVID-19 ARDS.
Key Benefits
Immune regulation and reduced inflammation, neuroprotection and circadian rhythm support, respiratory health improvement, direct CNS delivery bypassing BBB, correction of CIRS inflammatory markers, potential cognitive and mood benefits.
Mechanism of Action
VIP binds to VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors coupled to Gαs proteins, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cAMP/PKA signaling. This leads to anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), modulation of T helper cell differentiation, and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

Glutathione levels decline with age and are depleted by stress, toxins, and certain diseases. Injectable forms bypass poor oral bioavailability to deliver glutathione directly to tissues.
Key Benefits
Direct delivery bypasses poor oral bioavailability. Rapidly increases plasma glutathione levels. Supports detoxification, immune function, and antioxidant defense systems.
Mechanism of Action
Glutathione directly neutralizes reactive oxygen species via its sulfhydryl group, conjugates toxins for excretion (Phase II detoxification), recycles vitamins C and E, and supports optimal lymphocyte function. The tripeptide's unique gamma peptide bond protects it from degradation by most peptidases.",,"Antioxidant Support
Most Effective
Master Antioxidant Function
Glutathione is the body's primary intracellular antioxidant. Its sulfhydryl group donates electrons to neutralize free radicals and reactive oxygen species before they damage cells.
Antioxidant Recycling
Regenerates oxidized vitamins C and E back to their active forms, extending their protective capacity through the glutathione-ascorbate cycle.
Cellular Redox Balance
Maintains optimal GSH/GSSG ratio (typically >100:1 in healthy cells). This ratio is a key indicator of cellular health and oxidative stress status.

Cellular Redox Balance
Maintains optimal GSH/GSSG ratio (typically >100:1 in healthy cells). This ratio is a key indicator of cellular health and oxidative stress status.
Phase II Liver Detoxification
Glutathione S-transferase enzymes conjugate GSH to toxins, drugs, and xenobiotics, converting them to water-soluble compounds for excretion via bile and urine.
Heavy Metal Binding
Sulfhydryl group binds toxic heavy metals including mercury, cadmium, lead, and arsenic, facilitating their safe elimination from the body.
Acetaminophen Detoxification
Detoxifies NAPQI, the hepatotoxic metabolite of acetaminophen. Glutathione depletion from overdose leads to liver failure; NAC restores GSH for treatment.
T-Cell Support
Essential for T-lymphocyte proliferation and function. GSH-deficient T cells cannot properly expand or mount effective immune responses.
NK Cell Activity
Some research shows up to 400% increase in natural killer cell activity with IV glutathione therapy, though results vary between studies.
Macrophage Function
Modulates macrophage activation, cytokine release, and proper redox activity critical for pathogen elimination.
Parkinson's Disease Research
GSH is depleted 40% in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Clinical trials of IV and intranasal glutathione show potential symptom improvement, though evidence remains preliminary.
Neuroprotection
Protects neurons from oxidative damage. Low glutathione is associated with neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Blood-Brain Barrier
Intranasal administration has been shown to increase brain glutathione levels, potentially overcoming the blood-brain barrier limitation of IV delivery.
Skin Lightening Effects
Inhibits tyrosinase enzyme and shifts melanin production from eumelanin (dark) to pheomelanin (lighter). Evidence from RCTs is limited and effects are modest.
Antioxidant Skin Protection
Protects skin from UV-induced oxidative damage. May support overall skin health through reduced oxidative stress rather than direct lightening effects.
Important Caution
IV glutathione for skin lightening carries serious safety concerns including hepatotoxicity and anaphylaxis. Philippine FDA has issued warnings against this use.","Disclaimer: These are commonly discussed research protocols and not medical advice. Consult a healthcare provider before use.

Proper Form (Reduced GSH)
Ensure product contains reduced glutathione (GSH), not oxidized glutathione (GSSG), which must be converted by the body.
Clear Labeling
Product should clearly list concentration (e.g., 200mg/mL), lot number, expiration date, and proper storage requirements.
Healthcare Provider Supervision
IV administration should be performed by or under supervision of licensed healthcare provider who can manage potential adverse reactions.
pH Affects Comfort
Improperly buffered glutathione causes significant injection site stinging/pain. Quality formulations should be pH-adjusted to 6.0-7.0, close to physiological pH.
Short Half-Life
Plasma glutathione has a short half-life (~14 minutes). Benefits come from repeated administration and supporting endogenous production, not single doses.
Variable Bioavailability
Even with injection, cellular uptake varies. Some tissues take up glutathione better than others. Brain uptake is limited without intranasal route.
Unregulated Sources
Avoid products from non-licensed sources. Contamination, incorrect concentration, and degraded product are significant risks.","Week 1-2: Minimal noticeable effects. Plasma glutathione levels increase acutely after each injection but have short half-life (~14 minutes for reduced GSH).
Week 2-4: Some may notice improved energy or recovery. Detoxification processes are supported. Individual responses vary significantly.
Week 4-8: Potential improvements in skin appearance, immune resilience, or neurological symptoms depending on indication. Effects are often subtle.
Important: Glutathione is supportive therapy. Do not expect dramatic overnight changes. Benefits accumulate with consistent use over time.
Note: Skin lightening effects (if any) are modest and temporary, requiring ongoing treatment to maintain.","Generally well-tolerated when used appropriately
Injection site pain/stinging is common if pH is not properly balanced (optimal pH 6.0-7.0) - quality formulations should be pH-buffered close to physiological levels

Thymulin (also known as Serum Thymic Factor or FTS - Facteur Thymique Sérique) is a 9-amino acid metallopeptide hormone produced exclusively by thymic epithelial cells. First characterized by Bach and colleagues in 1977, thymulin is unique in requiring zinc binding (1:1 equimolecular ratio) for biological activity. The zinc-thymulin complex adopts a specific three-dimensional conformation essential for its immunomodulatory functions, including T-cell differentiation, NK cell enhancement, and suppressor T-cell regulation. Beyond immune functions, thymulin demonstrates potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties through inhibition of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum thymulin levels decline progressively with age (peaking in pre-adolescence), contributing to immunosenescence. Research shows promise in lung diseases, neuropathic pain, and age-related immune dysfunction, though human clinical trials remain limited.
Key Benefits
Immune modulation, T-cell differentiation, anti-inflammatory effects, potential analgesic properties
Mechanism of Action
Zinc-dependent metallopeptide that binds to high-affinity T-cell receptors. Induces T-cell differentiation, enhances suppressor T-cell function, and modulates NK cell activity. Anti-inflammatory action via NF-κB inhibition, p38 MAPK suppression, and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). May also act through α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor potentiation for analgesic effects.","Weight

AHK-Cu (Copper Tripeptide-3),Hair Growth Copper Peptide | Dermal Papilla Stimulator,Topical,0.5-1% concentration applied to scalp or skin,Topical,12-24 weeks minimum,Refrigerate at 2-8°C; protect from light; use reconstituted solutions within 30 days,Once or twice daily,,,Week 2-4: Reduced shedding may begin; Month 2-3: New growth visible; Month 4-6: Significant improvement; 6-12 months: Full results,Minimum 12-24 weeks for hair growth assessment; can be used continuously,Not typically cycled; continuous use for best results,"What is AHK-Cu (Copper Tripeptide-3)?
AHK-Cu (Copper Tripeptide-3) is a synthetic copper-binding tripeptide composed of Alanine-Histidine-Lysine complexed with a copper ion (Cu²⁺). While structurally similar to the naturally occurring GHK-Cu (differing only in the first amino acid - alanine vs glycine), AHK-Cu demonstrates targeted activity on dermal papilla cells and hair follicles. Research shows it stimulates hair follicle elongation, promotes dermal papilla cell proliferation, increases VEGF production, and inhibits TGF-β1 - making it particularly promising for hair growth applications. It also supports skin regeneration through fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis.
Key Benefits
Stimulates hair follicle elongation, promotes dermal papilla cell proliferation, increases VEGF for improved scalp circulation, reduces TGF-β1 (counters DHT effects), anti-apoptotic protection for follicles, collagen synthesis support, convenient topical application
Mechanism of Action
AHK-Cu penetrates the scalp to deliver copper directly to dermal papilla cells and hair follicles. It activates proliferation pathways, elevates the Bcl-2/Bax ratio (anti-apoptotic), increases VEGF production for enhanced blood flow, reduces TGF-β1 secretion, and promotes SOD production to reduce oxidative stress. These combined effects support the anagen (growth) phase and may help revive miniaturized follicles.","Weight

Some prefer pre-workout timing.,"Energy effects (if deficient): days to weeks. Body composition: requires diet and exercise, any effects modest over 4-12 weeks.",4-12 weeks typical program length,Breaks not typically required - can be used ongoing,"What is Fat Blaster?
Fat Blaster is a lipotropic injection blend combining L-Carnitine, Methionine-Inositol-Choline (MIC), B vitamins (B6, B12), and NADH. This enhanced formulation builds on traditional MIC injections by adding L-Carnitine for fatty acid transport and NADH for cellular energy metabolism. Formulations vary significantly between vendors, with ingredient ratios and concentrations differing. While individual components have documented metabolic roles with varying levels of clinical evidence, no published studies have examined this specific combination for weight loss.
Key Benefits
Enhanced lipotropic formula combining L-Carnitine for fatty acid transport, MIC for liver support, B vitamins for energy metabolism, and NADH for cellular energy. Components have varying levels of clinical evidence.
Mechanism of Action
L-Carnitine shuttles fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. MIC components (methionine, inositol, choline) act as methyl donors and lipotropic agents supporting liver fat metabolism. B6 and B12 support protein and energy metabolism. NADH participates in cellular ATP production. Note: Clinical evidence for this specific combination is absent - effects extrapolated from individual component studies.",,"Fat Metabolism

SNAP-8 (Acetyl Octapeptide-3) is a synthetic octapeptide developed as a topical alternative to botulinum toxin for reducing dynamic facial wrinkles. It works by mimicking the N-terminal end of SNAP-25 protein to competitively inhibit SNARE complex formation, thereby reducing acetylcholine release and muscle contractions. Clinical studies demonstrate up to 63% wrinkle depth reduction with consistent topical application.
Key Benefits
Non-invasive alternative to Botox, reduces expression lines and dynamic wrinkles by up to 63%, safe for sensitive skin areas including around the eyes, no recovery time required
Mechanism of Action
SNAP-8 mimics the N-terminal end of SNAP-25 protein and competes for binding sites in the SNARE complex. This destabilization prevents efficient neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction, reducing muscle contractions and preventing formation of expression lines and wrinkles","Weight

Testagen (KEDG, Lys-Glu-Asp-Gly) is a synthetic tetrapeptide bioregulator developed by Russian scientist Vladimir Khavinson and his team at the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology. Derived from amino acid sequences found in anterior pituitary gland extracts, Testagen is researched for its potential effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release, thyroid function, and downstream testosterone regulation. As part of the Khavinson peptide family, it is proposed to cross cell and nuclear membranes to directly interact with DNA and modulate gene expression in target tissues.
Key Benefits
Direct systemic absorption, precise dosing control, bypasses GI degradation, supports anterior pituitary function, potential thyroid and testosterone optimization through TSH modulation.
Mechanism of Action
Testagen (KEDG) is proposed to cross both cell and nuclear membranes to interact directly with DNA in anterior pituitary cells. This may stimulate TSH release, subsequently influencing T3/T4 thyroid hormone production. Improved thyroid function is correlated with normalized testosterone levels, suggesting a potential indirect mechanism for testosterone support.","Weight

Testagen (KEDG, Lys-Glu-Asp-Gly) is a synthetic tetrapeptide bioregulator developed by Russian scientist Vladimir Khavinson and his team at the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology. Derived from amino acid sequences found in anterior pituitary gland extracts, Testagen is researched for its potential effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release, thyroid function, and downstream testosterone regulation. As part of the Khavinson peptide family, it is proposed to cross cell and nuclear membranes to directly interact with DNA and modulate gene expression in target tissues.

Hexarelin (also known as Examorelin) is a synthetic hexapeptide growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) and one of the most potent GH secretagogues studied. Derived from GHRP-6 by Mediolanum Farmaceutici, it stimulates growth hormone release through the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) and uniquely binds to cardiac CD36 receptors, providing cardioprotective effects independent of GH release. Hexarelin reached Phase II clinical trials for growth hormone deficiency and congestive heart failure but was discontinued in 2005 for strategic reasons. Research demonstrates its potential in cardioprotection, neuroprotection, and metabolic regulation.
Key Benefits

GHRP + GHRH combination provides complementary GH release through different receptor pathways. Studies show synergistic peak GH secretion rates greater than the arithmetic sum of isolated administration.
GHRH analog enhances hexarelin's pulsatile GH release. Research demonstrates synergistic effects when co-administered, though synergy diminishes with repeated dosing.
Both are GHRPs with different selectivity profiles. Combining may soften hexarelin's cortisol/prolactin elevation while maintaining GH output through complementary receptor activity.
Both GHRPs stimulate GH through similar pathways. Combination may cause excessive GH spikes and additive side effects including cortisol and prolactin elevation.
Structurally similar GHRPs with overlapping mechanisms. Combining provides diminishing returns with increased risk of hormonal side effects.
DAC version provides continuous GH elevation which may conflict with hexarelin's pulsatile release pattern, potentially reducing synergistic benefits and accelerating desensitization.
Both stimulate GH through ghrelin receptor. MK-677's continuous oral action combined with hexarelin may lead to excessive and prolonged GH elevation requiring monitoring.
FDA-approved GHRH analog works through complementary pathway. Studies on GHRH + hexarelin combinations show synergistic GH release significantly greater than either alone.
Exogenous HGH suppresses natural GH release pathways. Combining defeats hexarelin's purpose and may cause excessive GH levels with increased side effects.

Hexarelin (also known as Examorelin) is a synthetic hexapeptide growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) and one of the most potent GH secretagogues studied. Derived from GHRP-6 by Mediolanum Farmaceutici, it stimulates growth hormone release through the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) and uniquely binds to cardiac CD36 receptors, providing cardioprotective effects independent of GH release. Hexarelin reached Phase II clinical trials for growth hormone deficiency and congestive heart failure but was discontinued in 2005 for strategic reasons. Research demonstrates its potential in cardioprotection, neuroprotection, and metabolic regulation.

GHRP + GHRH combination provides complementary GH release through different receptor pathways. Studies show synergistic peak GH secretion rates greater than the arithmetic sum of isolated administration.
GHRH analog enhances hexarelin's pulsatile GH release. Research demonstrates synergistic effects when co-administered, though synergy diminishes with repeated dosing.
Both are GHRPs with different selectivity profiles. Combining may soften hexarelin's cortisol/prolactin elevation while maintaining GH output through complementary receptor activity.
Both GHRPs stimulate GH through similar pathways. Combination may cause excessive GH spikes and additive side effects including cortisol and prolactin elevation.
Structurally similar GHRPs with overlapping mechanisms. Combining provides diminishing returns with increased risk of hormonal side effects.
DAC version provides continuous GH elevation which may conflict with hexarelin's pulsatile release pattern, potentially reducing synergistic benefits and accelerating desensitization.
Both stimulate GH through ghrelin receptor. MK-677's continuous oral action combined with hexarelin may lead to excessive and prolonged GH elevation requiring monitoring.
FDA-approved GHRH analog works through complementary pathway. Studies on GHRH + hexarelin combinations show synergistic GH release significantly greater than either alone.
Exogenous HGH suppresses natural GH release pathways. Combining defeats hexarelin's purpose and may cause excessive GH levels with increased side effects.

CagriSema combination demonstrates enhanced weight loss (22.7% vs 16.1% semaglutide alone) and improved glycemic control through complementary GLP-1 and amylin pathways.
No known direct interactions. Both are effective weight loss agents with different mechanisms - cagrilintide targets amylin/calcitonin receptors while tirzepatide targets GLP-1/GIP receptors.
Both cause significant GI effects (gastroparesis, nausea). Cagrilintide (amylin agonist) and Retatrutide (triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon agonist) have different mechanisms but compounded GI side effects create substantial risk. Not recommended without specialist supervision.
Phase 2 trials show similar efficacy profiles with no adverse interactions. Both GLP-1 agonists and amylin analogs work through distinct satiety pathways.
Monitor glucose levels closely as cagrilintide affects gastric emptying and may alter insulin absorption timing. May require insulin dose adjustments in diabetic patients.
Well-tolerated combination demonstrated in Phase 2/3 trials. No pharmacokinetic interactions observed between cagrilintide and metformin.
Clinical trials included patients on SGLT2 inhibitors with no safety concerns. Both mechanisms complement each other for diabetes and weight management.
Both are amylin receptor agonists with overlapping mechanisms. Combination would provide no additional benefit and may increase risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
Delayed gastric emptying may affect absorption of oral contraceptives. Space administration by 1 hour before cagrilintide injection.","Important: pH CRITICAL: Cagrilintide requires acidic pH (3.5-4.5) to prevent fibril formation. Standard BAC water (pH 5.5-6) is acceptable for short-term use (<30 days). For optimal long-term stability, acidify to pH ~4.0 with 0.6% acetic acid.
Reconstitute slowly down side of vial, swirl gently (don't shake)
Verify solution is clear - any cloudiness or particles indicates fibril formation, discard immediately

Frozen storage stability
Proper frozen storage at -20°C maintains stability of lipidated peptide structure
Extended stability profile
Long-acting formulation provides stable pharmacokinetics over 7-day dosing interval
Fibril formation at improper pH
Amylin analogs have inherent tendency to form amyloid fibrils, especially at neutral or alkaline pH. Solution should remain clear - any cloudiness, visible particles, or gel-like texture indicates fibril formation and the product should be discarded immediately
Aggregation or precipitation
Any visible particles, cloudiness, or color changes indicate protein degradation
Temperature excursions
Exposure to repeated freeze-thaw cycles or high temperatures can denature the peptide structure
pH-dependent stability - reconstitution concerns
Cagrilintide requires acidic formulation (pH 3.5-4.5) for optimal stability. Reconstitution with standard bacteriostatic water (pH 5.5-6) is acceptable for short-term use (<30 days refrigerated) but may cause gradual degradation. Higher pH environments can lead to deamidation and protein aggregation. Pharmaceutical formulations use pH ~4.0 for maximum stability

Mazdutide (IBI362/LY3305677) is a first-in-class dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptor agonist, and a synthetic analog of oxyntomodulin. Unlike tirzepatide which targets GIP/GLP-1, mazdutide uniquely combines GLP-1's appetite suppression with glucagon's ability to stimulate thermogenesis and increase energy expenditure. Phase 3 trials (GLORY-1, GLORY-2) have demonstrated up to 20% weight loss, with recent head-to-head trials showing superiority over semaglutide for both glycemic control and weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
Key Benefits
Up to 20% body weight loss, superior glycemic control vs semaglutide, increased energy expenditure via glucagon receptor activation, improved cardiometabolic markers (BP, lipids, liver fat), once-weekly convenience
Mechanism of Action
Dual agonist of GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. GLP-1 activation: stimulates insulin release, suppresses glucagon, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite via hypothalamic signaling. Glucagon activation: increases energy expenditure and thermogenesis, improves hepatic fat metabolism. The dual mechanism provides synergistic weight loss effects while GLP-1 counteracts glucagon's glucose-raising effects.","Weight

Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) is a naturally occurring small cyclic dipeptide belonging to the 2,5-diketopiperazine family. It is endogenous to the human body, found in plasma, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid. cGP is a metabolite of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and plays a key role in regulating IGF-1 bioavailability by competing with IGF-1 for binding to IGFBP-3. Research suggests cGP has neuroprotective, nootropic, and cardioprotective properties, with clinical trials showing benefits for cognitive function, stroke recovery, and metabolic health.
Key Benefits
Neuroprotection, cognitive enhancement, IGF-1 optimization, cardiovascular support, metabolic health, convenient oral administration, crosses blood-brain barrier
Mechanism of Action
cGP competes with IGF-1 for binding to IGFBP-3, thereby regulating the amount of bioavailable IGF-1 in circulation. It normalizes IGF-1 function - promoting activity when insufficient and inhibiting when excessive. Also acts as positive allosteric modulator of AMPA and GABA-A receptors and increases BDNF levels.","Weight

L-Carnitine (levocarnitine) is a naturally occurring amino acid derivative essential for transporting long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production via beta-oxidation. Synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine, it plays critical roles in energy metabolism, particularly in high-energy tissues like heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. FDA approved as Carnitor® for treating primary and secondary carnitine deficiency. Various forms exist including Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) for cognitive support, L-Carnitine L-Tartrate (LCLT) for exercise recovery, and Propionyl-L-Carnitine for cardiovascular health. Extensively studied with over 200 clinical trials examining effects on weight management, exercise performance, heart health, cognitive function, and male fertility.
Key Benefits
Convenient, well-studied, multiple forms available (L-Carnitine, ALCAR, LCLT). Extensively researched for weight management, exercise performance, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. Most accessible form for general supplementation.
Mechanism of Action
Oral L-Carnitine is absorbed via carrier-mediated transport and passive diffusion with 14-18% bioavailability for supplements (up to 87% from dietary sources). Once absorbed, it facilitates transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Different forms target specific benefits: ALCAR crosses blood-brain barrier for cognitive effects, LCLT for exercise recovery, base L-Carnitine for general metabolic support.",,"Weight Loss

PE-22-28, also known as Mini-Spadin, is a synthetic heptapeptide derived from positions 22-28 of the parent peptide Spadin. Spadin itself originates from the propeptide (PE) released during the maturation of sortilin/neurotensin receptor-3 (NTSR3). PE-22-28 is a potent and selective antagonist of TREK-1 (TWIK-Related Potassium Channel-1), a two-pore domain potassium channel implicated in depression, neuroprotection, and pain modulation. With an IC50 of 0.12 nM, PE-22-28 demonstrates approximately 300-500 fold greater affinity for TREK-1 compared to full-length Spadin. Preclinical research shows rapid antidepressant effects within 4 days, accompanied by neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the hippocampus - significantly faster than conventional SSRIs.
Key Benefits
Rapid antidepressant-like effects (4 days in preclinical models), hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptogenesis (PSD-95 increase), CREB activation, enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission, potential neuroprotection, extended duration of action (~23 hours)
Mechanism of Action
PE-22-28 selectively blocks TREK-1 potassium channels with IC50 of 0.12 nM. TREK-1 inhibition increases neuronal excitability in the dorsal raphe nucleus, enhancing serotonin (5-HT) firing rate and neurotransmission. This triggers downstream CREB phosphorylation, BDNF expression, and hippocampal neurogenesis. Unlike SSRIs that take weeks, these effects manifest within 4 days in animal models.","Weight

Both bind to pituitary GHRH receptors. Combining saturates receptors without amplifying GH release, risking receptor desensitization and blunted pulsatility. Choose one based on your protocol goals.
Both target GHRH receptors but with conflicting release patterns. Tesamorelin promotes pulsatile GH release while DAC provides continuous stimulation, disrupting natural GH rhythms and accelerating receptor downregulation.
Similar GHRH mechanism but Tesamorelin has longer half-life. Low doses may be complementary, but higher doses risk excessive GH stimulation.

Injectable peptide effects poorly characterized due to short half-life.,10-30 days (anecdotal),3-4 weeks minimum between cycles (anecdotal),"What is Follistatin 344?
Follistatin 344 (FS-344) is a naturally occurring glycoprotein that inhibits myostatin and activin A, members of the TGF-β superfamily that suppress muscle growth. The FS-344 gene encodes a 344-amino acid precursor that is cleaved to produce the circulating FS-315 isoform. Gene therapy studies in primates and human clinical trials for muscular dystrophy have demonstrated significant muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. However, injectable peptide use has very limited human data, a short half-life (~90 minutes), and most research involves gene delivery rather than exogenous peptide administration. Follistatin has been banned by WADA since 2019.
Key Benefits
Myostatin and activin A inhibition, potential muscle growth enhancement, studied for muscular dystrophy therapy
Mechanism of Action
Binds and neutralizes myostatin and activin A, preventing their interaction with ActRIIB receptors on muscle cells. This blocks TGF-β signaling that normally suppresses muscle growth, allowing enhanced hypertrophy.","Weight

FOXO4-DRI (FOXO4-D-Retro-Inverso) is a synthetic 46-amino acid peptide designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells -damaged cells that accumulate with age and secrete harmful inflammatory factors (SASP). The peptide uses D-amino acids in reversed sequence, making it resistant to proteolytic degradation while maintaining binding function. FOXO4-DRI works by disrupting the FOXO4-p53 interaction that keeps senescent cells alive, causing p53 nuclear exclusion and redirecting it to mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. In mouse studies, it restored fur density, renal function, and physical fitness in aged animals while protecting against chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Notably, it shows 11.73-fold selectivity for senescent over healthy cells. No human clinical trials have been conducted; all efficacy data comes from preclinical animal and cell studies. The peptide was first described by Dr. Peter de Keizer and colleagues at Erasmus University Medical Center in 2017.
Key Benefits
Selective senescent cell elimination, tissue homeostasis restoration, potential anti-aging effects

Dihexa is a synthetic oligopeptide derived from angiotensin IV that potently enhances cognitive function by promoting synaptogenesis. Originally developed at Washington State University for Alzheimer's disease, it's 7 orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF at stimulating new synaptic connections and uniquely crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Key Benefits
Dramatic synaptogenesis promotion, cognitive enhancement, memory improvement, neuroprotection, potential neuroregeneration. May help with Alzheimer's, TBI, and age-related cognitive decline.
Mechanism of Action
Dihexa binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with high affinity and potentiates its activity at c-Met receptor, activating PI3K/AKT pathways. This promotes formation of new synaptic connections at levels 10 million times more potent than BDNF. Crosses blood-brain barrier effectively via oral or injectable routes.","Weight

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) is FDA-approved for treating male hypogonadism (low testosterone) caused by testicular failure or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Testosterone cypionate and enanthate are the most commonly prescribed injectable esters, providing sustained testosterone levels with weekly or bi-weekly dosing. The TRAVERSE trial (5,200+ participants) confirmed cardiovascular safety in high-risk men when used as indicated.
Key Benefits
Most effective TRT delivery method with predictable testosterone levels. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration provides sustained release over 7-8 days. Significantly improves energy, libido, mood, muscle mass, and bone density in hypogonadal men.
Mechanism of Action
Testosterone esters (cypionate/enanthate) are dissolved in oil and injected, where they slowly release testosterone as the ester bond is cleaved. Cypionate has ~8-day half-life, enanthate ~7 days. Testosterone then binds to androgen receptors, modulating gene expression for anabolic and androgenic effects.","Weight

Fat Mass Reduction
Studies demonstrate 2-4kg fat loss, particularly visceral fat, with testosterone optimization.
Muscle Strength
10-13% improvement in muscle strength measures reported in clinical trials of hypogonadal men.
Insulin Sensitivity
TRT may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, with TRAVERSE showing reduced diabetes progression.
Cardiovascular Safety
TRAVERSE trial confirmed TRT noninferior to placebo for major adverse cardiac events in high-risk men.
Bone Density
Testosterone maintains bone mineral density. Note: TRAVERSE substudy unexpectedly showed increased fracture risk.","Disclaimer: TRT is typically a lifelong commitment for diagnosed hypogonadism. Exogenous testosterone suppresses natural production via HPG axis feedback. Discontinuation requires medical supervision and may involve PCT protocols (clomiphene, hCG) to restore endogenous production, though recovery is not guaranteed. This is not medical advice.

For PCT, standard 2-3 week protocols","What is HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)?
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) is a glycoprotein hormone naturally produced by the placenta during pregnancy. It consists of two subunits: an alpha subunit identical to other pituitary hormones (LH, FSH, TSH) and a unique beta subunit that confers HCG's specific biological activity. Pharmaceutical HCG is derived from the urine of pregnant women or produced recombinantly. It binds to and activates LH receptors, making it valuable for treating hypogonadism, infertility, and cryptorchidism. In TRT protocols, HCG is commonly used to maintain testicular function, preserve fertility, and prevent testicular atrophy.
Key Benefits
Maintains testicular function during TRT, preserves fertility, prevents testicular atrophy, stimulates endogenous testosterone production, induces ovulation in women, treats cryptorchidism in children
Mechanism of Action
HCG binds to LH receptors on Leydig cells in the testes, stimulating testosterone and estrogen biosynthesis. In women, it acts on ovarian theca cells to stimulate progesterone production and triggers final oocyte maturation. Half-life is approximately 24-36 hours with peak levels 6-12 hours post-injection. Bioavailability is 40-50% via subcutaneous or intramuscular routes.","Weight

HCG is frequently used alongside TRT to maintain testicular function, preserve fertility, and prevent atrophy. Standard TRT protocol: 250-500 IU HCG twice weekly
Both stimulate testosterone production via different mechanisms. Sometimes used sequentially in PCT protocols. Generally not combined simultaneously - choose one approach
HCG increases intratesticular aromatase activity and may elevate estrogen. AIs like anastrozole are often used concurrently to manage estrogen levels during TRT+HCG protocols
GnRH agonists/antagonists suppress LH. HCG may be used to maintain testicular function during GnRH analog therapy or for recovery afterward. Timing coordination required
Combined HCG + FSH therapy is standard for male infertility treatment in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, achieving spermatogenesis in 70-90% of patients
Both stimulate the HPG axis via different mechanisms. Kisspeptin acts upstream at the hypothalamus while HCG acts directly on gonads. Potentially synergistic for fertility restoration
High-dose HCG has weak TSH-like activity due to alpha subunit homology. Can cause transient hyperthyroidism with very high HCG levels (pregnancy, tumors). Monitor thyroid function

Optimal results: 6-8 weeks of consistent use,4-8 weeks,4-8 weeks off between cycles to prevent receptor desensitization,"What is PEG-MGF?
PEG-MGF (Pegylated Mechano Growth Factor) is a modified form of the IGF-1 splice variant MGF (IGF-1Ec), with polyethylene glycol attached to extend its half-life from minutes to hours. MGF is naturally expressed in muscle tissue following mechanical stress or injury, where it activates satellite cells to support muscle repair. A landmark 2011 human cell study (cited 74+ times) showed MGF significantly increased satellite cell proliferation at doses as low as 3ng/ml, with effects on proliferative lifespan in young but not elderly donors. While in vitro and animal studies show promise for muscle regeneration, tissue repair, and neuroprotection, human clinical research remains limited. PEG-MGF is not FDA-approved and is classified as a research chemical.
Key Benefits
Extended half-life (hours vs minutes for unmodified MGF) through PEGylation. Activates satellite cells for muscle repair and regeneration. May support recovery from mechanical stress or injury.
Mechanism of Action
PEG-MGF activates muscle satellite (stem) cells by binding to specific receptors, stimulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This enhances protein synthesis and promotes muscle fiber repair. The E-peptide domain appears to have distinct activity from mature IGF-1.","Weight

Tesofensine (NS2330) is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor that blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Originally developed for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, it demonstrated significant weight loss effects in early trials, leading to its development as an anti-obesity agent. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials have shown weight loss of 10-12% over 24 weeks, making it one of the more effective investigational weight loss compounds. It works primarily by suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure through central nervous system mechanisms.
Key Benefits
Potent appetite suppression with significant weight loss (9-12% over 24 weeks). Once-daily oral dosing with long half-life (~9 days). May also increase resting energy expenditure. Different mechanism than GLP-1 agonists offers alternative approach.
Mechanism of Action
Tesofensine is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor that blocks reuptake of dopamine (IC50: 6.5nM), norepinephrine (IC50: 1.7nM), and serotonin (IC50: 11nM). This increases neurotransmitter levels in the hypothalamus and other brain regions controlling appetite and satiety.

A combination protocol using CJC-1295 without DAC (also known as Mod GRF 1-29) and Ipamorelin through complementary receptor mechanisms. CJC-1295 without DAC has a short half-life of 30 minutes to 2 hours, enabling pulsatile GH release that mimics natural physiology. Ipamorelin provides selective GH release without affecting cortisol, ACTH, or prolactin. Note: This protocol uses the no-DAC version specifically for pulsatile release patterns.
Key Benefits
Dual-pathway GH optimization through complementary mechanisms. CJC-1295 without DAC (Mod GRF 1-29) and Ipamorelin both have short half-lives (30 min-2 hours), producing synergistic pulsatile GH spikes that mimic natural physiology without cortisol effects.
Mechanism of Action
CJC-1295 without DAC (Mod GRF 1-29) stimulates GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotrophs, triggering cAMP/PKA-mediated GH synthesis with a short 30-minute to 2-hour half-life. Ipamorelin selectively activates ghrelin receptors (GHSR1a) via Gq/11-linked calcium signaling without affecting ACTH or cortisol pathways. Together, the dual-pathway activation produces amplified, pulsatile GH spikes. Note: Combination benefits are theoretically sound but lack direct clinical validation.",,"Muscle Growth

Oxytocin is a nine-amino-acid peptide hormone and neuropeptide naturally produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Known as the ""love hormone"" or ""bonding hormone,"" it plays fundamental roles in social bonding, trust, empathy, sexual reproduction, childbirth, and lactation. Synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin/Syntocinon) is FDA-approved for labor induction and postpartum hemorrhage control, while intranasal formulations are being researched for autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression, PTSD, chronic pain, and sexual dysfunction.
Key Benefits
Sublingual/buccal troches bypass first-pass metabolism, convenient administration, no injection required, emerging research on bioavailability
Mechanism of Action
Sublingual absorption through oral mucosa allows partial bypass of gastrointestinal degradation. Estimated bioavailability ~4.5% compared to ~11% intranasal. Reaches systemic circulation to act on peripheral and central oxytocin receptors.","Weight

Structurally similar peptides (differ by only 2 amino acids) with overlapping receptor affinity. Both act on oxytocin and vasopressin receptors with potential for additive effects.
Complementary anxiolytic effects through different mechanisms. Selank modulates GABA while oxytocin acts on central oxytocin receptors for stress reduction.
No known interactions. Different mechanisms - Semax for cognitive enhancement, oxytocin for social/emotional support.
Complementary effects on sexual function. PT-141 acts on melanocortin receptors while oxytocin enhances bonding, arousal, and orgasm intensity.
Both involved in reproductive function through different pathways. Kisspeptin stimulates GnRH while oxytocin enhances arousal and bonding.
No known direct interactions. Different mechanisms - BPC-157 for tissue repair, oxytocin for social/reproductive functions.
SSRIs may affect endogenous oxytocin levels. Combined use may have additive effects on mood but should be monitored by healthcare provider.
Both have anxiolytic effects through different mechanisms. Combined use may cause enhanced sedation or additive effects on blood pressure.
Prostaglandins enhance oxytocin sensitivity in uterine tissue. Often used together clinically for labor induction.
Alcohol suppresses oxytocin release and may reduce therapeutic effects. Both can affect blood pressure and judgment.","Important: Use sterile water or sterile saline only. Benzyl alcohol (in BAC water) degrades oxytocin. For multi-dose, refrigerate and use within 48-72 hours, or freeze single-dose aliquots.
Obtain compounded oxytocin troches from licensed pharmacy
Place troche under tongue or between gum and cheek
Allow to dissolve completely (15-30 minutes)
Do not chew or swallow whole
Avoid eating or drinking for 15 minutes before and after
Alternate sides of mouth with each dose
Store as directed by compounding pharmacy","Licensed compounding pharmacy
Troches should be prepared by accredited compounding pharmacy following USP guidelines
Appropriate dissolution time
Quality troches dissolve slowly over 15-30 minutes for optimal absorption
Limited research compared to intranasal
Most clinical evidence for oxytocin uses intranasal route - sublingual has less data
Lower bioavailability
Higher doses may be needed compared to intranasal to achieve similar effects","More gradual onset compared to intranasal (30-45 min)
Effects may be subtler due to lower bioavailability
Convenient for those preferring oral administration
Individual response varies - some may need intranasal for stronger effects","Less clinical data than intranasal - effects may be less predictable
Higher doses used to compensate for lower bioavailability
Same general safety profile as intranasal oxytocin
Ensure troche dissolves completely - swallowing reduces absorption
